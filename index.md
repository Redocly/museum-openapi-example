# Museum API project

The Museum API is a sample API that you can use to try out new API tools, to learn more about OpenAPI, or whatever else you need.
The [OpenAPI description](./openapi.yaml) is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/Redocly/museum-openapi-example).
When a new version is released, the API `info.version` field is updated, so check that value when things change.

## `openapi.yaml`

The API description can be found in `openapi.yaml`.
You can download it and use it as you wish.

## Use Redocly CLI

[Redocly CLI](https://github.com/Redocly/redocly-cli) is an open source CLI utility for all things OpenAPI.
Try Redocly CLI to get to grips with some of the different things you can do with OpenAPI.

- Use `stats` to assess an API: `redocly stats openapi.yaml`.
- Run `lint` to observe if an OpenAPI is compatible with a set of standards: `redocly lint openapi.yaml`.
- View API reference documentation: `redocly preview-docs openapi.yaml`.

The [Redocly CLI documentation](https://redocly.com/docs/cli/) has all the information you need to dive into more detail on any of these common tasks, and of course many more!

## Build an API experience

A key part of great API experience is great documentation.
Taking the API reference as the heart of the experience, Redocly's platform goes much further and includes a full documentation platform.

Run `redocly preview` to run your project locally, and start adding content.
Or use the cloud editor with immediate preview and collaborative editing.

Write great content with great tools; Redocly supports [Markdoc](https://markdoc.dev/), a modern extension to Markdown.
(We use it ourselves and love it!)
If you're new to Markdown, visit our [Markdoc learning hub](https://redocly.com/docs/learn-markdoc/) to get started.
